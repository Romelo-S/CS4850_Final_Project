## Getting Started

Run Server then Run Client in order for the project to work. Java 17 used for this project. Libraries on both are imported.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## What is completed

This is the Version 2 of the Project. Half of the requirements are done. The who and logout works through the threading. Send to the server is utilized here but sending between users is not utilized.
